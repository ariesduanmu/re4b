This code, compiled in Linux x86-64 using GCC is crashing while execution (segmentation fault). It's also crashed if compiled by MinGW for win32. However, it works in Windows environment if compiled by MSVC 2010 x86. Why?

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void alter_string(char *s)
{
        strcpy (s, "Goodbye!");
        printf ("Result: %s\n", s);
};

int main()
{
        alter_string ("Hello, world!\n");
};
```

## Answer

```assembly
mov     dword ptr [esp], offset aHelloWorld ; "Hello, world!\n"
```

in `main` function it save the hexdump position of helloworld in stack


```assembly
mov     eax, [ebp+arg_0]
mov     dword ptr [eax], 646F6F47h
mov     dword ptr [eax+4], 21657962h
```

`alter_string` then let seax keep the hexdump position of helloworld


then the code try to rewrite the stack position where eax save, but it isnot exist in stack, so it crash with segmentation fault
