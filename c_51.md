If we compile this piece of code in MSVC and run it, three numbers are printed. Where do they come from? Where do they come from if you compile it in MSVC with optimization (\Ox)? Why is the situation completely different if we compile with GCC?


```assembly
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf ("%d, %d, %d\n");
	return 0;
};
```

## Answer


compile in gcc

it output the first 3 items from `[$esp+4]` `[$esp+8]` `[$esp+12]`

which are stack location of `a.out`, stack location of `/bin/bash` and point position of `main`

results are two negative integers and one positive

`-1073744892, -1073744884, 4198829`

and as the stack protection they keep changing

MSVC just return junks from same place in stack
