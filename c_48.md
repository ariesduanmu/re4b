What does this win32-function do?


```assembly
main:
    push 0xFFFFFFFF
    call MessageBeep
    xor  eax,eax
    retn
```

---


```c++
BOOL MessageBeep(
  UINT uType
);
```

`uType`

The sound to be played. The sounds are set by the user through the Sound control panel application, and then stored in the registry.

Value | Meaning

0xFFFFFFFF | A simple beep. If the sound card is not available, the sound is generated using the speaker.
