What does this code do?

```assembly
$SG3103	DB	'%d', 0aH, 00H

_main	PROC
	push	0
	call	DWORD PTR __imp___time64
	push	edx
	push	eax
	push	OFFSET $SG3103 ; '%d'
	call	DWORD PTR __imp__printf
	add	esp, 16
	xor	eax, eax
	ret	0
_main	ENDP
```

Additional question: why MSVC replaced time() with time64()? Is it correct? Dangerous? What printf() will print after year 2038?

## Answer

This function returns the time since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970 (Unix timestamp) in seconds.

time_64() is in 64 bit

2038 will over the limit of 2**31, so it is not safe to use time()
